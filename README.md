Auto Manifest
=============

Android projects set up via Gradle build system. `AndroidManifest.xml` file is crucial to define Android specific
 properties like `minSdkVersion`, `uses-permission` etc. Some of are defined through `build.gradle` and AGP (Android
  Gradle Plugin) merges them automatically.
  
Unfortunately, `package` property must be defined in `AndroidManifest.xml` and mandatory for `BuildConfig` and `R
` class generation. In most of my Gradle modules, `AndroidManifest.xml` is just 1 line:
```xml
<manifest package="foo" />
```

Here comes AutoManifest Gradle Plugin to rescue ðŸš€

Configuration
-------------

Add the plugin in your `build.gradle` file (preferably in root one)

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.gradleup.auto.manifest") version "1.0"
}

autoManifest {
    // Mandatory packageName
    packageName.set("com.company.example")

    // Applies recursively to sub-modules so you don't have to
    // Sub-module package names will be auto generated by using their relative path
    // Default: true
    applyRecursively.set(true)
}
```

Ta-da ðŸŽ‰ Now just put your Java/Kotlin files and don't worry about the rest.

Performance
-----------

This project uses Gradle's [Lazy Task Configuration APIs][lazy] and do not cause eager task creation in AGP. It also
 generates the `AndroidManifest.xml` file lazily. That means "zero" impact on Android Studio Sync times.
